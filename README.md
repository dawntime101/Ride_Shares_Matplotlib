Data analysis using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib on ride shares to show the relationship between four key variables:

* Average fare in dollars per city, total number of rides per city, total number of drivers per city, and city type (urban, suburban, rural)

% of total fares, % of total rides, and % of total drivers shown by city type in pie chart.


Some observable trends based on the data:

Urban areas have the highest number of rides, and the lowest fare by city type. This makes sense because urban areas are more densely populated, with less distance to travel between locations. On the contrary, Rural areas have the fewest number of rides, and the highest fare by city type. This also makes sense due to the distance to travel being longer in less developed areas. In our economy of ride sharing, the pie charts show us how supply truly meets demand by observing the amount of drivers in either urban, suburban and rural city types. 80% of drivers are based in urban areas, leaving us with our urban Pac-man of ride sharing to eat up the remaining 17% of suburban drivers, and the 3% in rural areas. 

In conclusion, ride sharing is more utilized, necessary, and affordable in urban areas.
